# COURSE_NOTES_APP

> This is a project that goes through what we have learned during the Node.js elective course in the fourth semester of the Computer Science program.

> Originally, the project was made as part of a large semester repository, but it has been moved to its own repository for submission purposes. This also means that there is no Git history. i think :D

> The purpose of the project has been to review all the material we have worked with during the first seven classes â€” it is structured according to each lesson, which is why it may sometimes seem random where certain things are placed in relation to others. Some parts appear gradually, while others are grouped together.
